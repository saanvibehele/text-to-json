This project demonstrates how to fine-tune large language models using **QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)**, enabling efficient training and inference on consumer-grade hardware.

## Features

- LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- Quantization for reduced memory footprint
- Training on custom datasets
- Evaluation of model performance
- Integration with HuggingFace Transformers and Datasets

## File Structure

```
.
├── qlora.ipynb         # Main Jupyter notebook for QLoRA fine-tuning
├── README.md           # Project instructions and documentation
```

## Requirements

Install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets peft accelerate bitsandbytes
```

## Instructions to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-to-json.git
   cd text-to-json
   ```

2. **Open Notebook in Colab:**

3. **Run the notebook cells:**
   - Follow the logical flow to load your model, dataset, quantize it, and fine-tune using QLoRA.

4. **Model Saving:**
   - The notebook includes steps to save the fine-tuned model for inference or future usage.

## Resources Used

- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)
- [PEFT: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning](https://github.com/huggingface/peft)
- [BitsAndBytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes)

## Customization

To fine-tune on your own data:
- Replace the dataset loading block with your custom dataset.
- Ensure your dataset is formatted as a HuggingFace `DatasetDict`.

## Notes

- Best run on a GPU-enabled environment (e.g., Google Colab).
- Fine-tuning large models requires adequate VRAM; QLoRA helps fit training into 16GB or even 8GB GPUs.
